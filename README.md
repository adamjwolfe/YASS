# YASS
YASS - Yet Another Soduko Solver

This code came out of an attempt to get my father to learn python. He had some ideas of how to solve sudoku puzzles, so I suggested that we try to code it up!

### Installation

Create a python3 virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then try out the included jupyter notebook.
